OVERVIEW

This project implements a fully decentralized prediction market on the Algorand blockchain, designed to enable users to trade predictions on future events in a secure, transparent, and trustless environment.
Prediction markets aggregate information by allowing users to buy and sell shares tied to the outcomes of events, with share prices dynamically adjusting based on the collective sentiment and information available in the market.

In this implementation, users can:

- Create prediction markets with defined outcomes
- Trade outcome shares using a simple swap mechanism
- Rely on decentralized mechanisms to resolve markets and claim payouts

The project serve as a demonstration of Algorand’s capabilities for building real-world financial infrastructures.

OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a decentralized, efficient, and user-friendly prediction market on Algorand, showcasing how blockchain technology can transform traditional financial mechanisms by removing the need for trusted intermediaries.

Specifically, the platform aims to:

- Provide a fully decentralized environment for creating and trading prediction markets without requiring a central authority
- Demonstrate how smart contracts can autonomously manage market operations, from order matching to payouts
- Use Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) to tokenize prediction shares and facilitate their trading
- Minimize user costs by leveraging Algorand’s low transaction fees and fast finality

Ultimately, the project shows how decentralized prediction markets can increase transparency, and serve as a blueprint for future decentralized applications (dApps) in the DeFi ecosystem.
